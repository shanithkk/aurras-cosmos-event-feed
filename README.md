# Event Feed - ICON

Aurras is a middleware that acts as an event processor and a low code workflow orchestration platform. Aurras is being pitched as a next-generation system for enabling decentralized push notification. This middleware solution listens to events from blockchain applications and propagates them to a registered pool of MQTT brokers. The broader architecture consists of parachain from which the middleware listens for the events.

This Event Feed package facilitates to source events from icon chains. The events will be posted to the OpenWhisk system. icon-sdk is used under the hood to establish the connection to blockchain nodes and receive events.
